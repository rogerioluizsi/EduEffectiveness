Respository of a machine learning method to compare educational effectiveness of political units. Thiis method were submitted  to a journal as a new contribution.

### Abstract
Studies comparing large-scale assessment data among educational systems have been
an important tool for understanding the differences in how education is delivered
worldwide. Many of these studies do not go beyond reporting average student scores
in a particular educational system. A more unbiased analysis would avoid the simple use
of gross performance and consider educational system contexts. A common approach is
to estimate effectiveness by the residuals of parametric linear models. These models
rely upon strong assumptions regarding the data-generating process, and are limited to
handling extensive datasets. To address this issue, our paper provides a new approach
based on machine learning models. The new approach is flexible, allows paired
comparison, and is model-independent. An analysis conducted in Brazil verifies the
suitability of the method to explore differences in effectiveness between Brazilian
educational administrative units at the regional and state levels from 2009 to 2019. Our
results are consistent with the existing literature, but the methodology produced a
number of new findings that were not observed in studies using more traditional
approaches
